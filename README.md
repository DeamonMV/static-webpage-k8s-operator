# static-webpage-k8s-operator

Purpose of this operator is deploy webserver with a static webpage.

**Note:** Current state of Operator is in alpha state:
- not very tested
- can have problems
- but can be used for not critical job


## Description

Operator deploys into cluster deployment, which is running pod with two containers:
nginx and git-sync.

Nginx container serve webpage, git-sync responsible for cloning repository, checkout then specific branch and then check for updates.

Nginx version nginx and git-sync is **hardcoded** - nginx:1.23.3 and registry.k8s.io/git-sync/git-sync:v3.6.4

Nginx running as is, more info you may find [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) . **Note** nginx will use as *index* `index.html` or `index.htm`

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

Use kubernetes 1.19+

### Running on the cluster
1. Deploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make deploy
```

2. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

If you want to some feature or know how to improve it create a PR.

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

## RoadMap

- [ ] Add tests to code
- [ ] Add ability to use own nginx image
- [ ] Add ability to pull images from private repositories
